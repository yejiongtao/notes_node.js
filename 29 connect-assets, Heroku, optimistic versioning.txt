1. connect-assets
	an alternative to Grunt
		can concatenate, compile to, and minify JS and CSS
			supports CoffeeScript, Stylus, LESS, SASS, EJS, etc
		doesn't support Browserify
		but very easy to use
	
	install
		connect-assets, and also the following compilers
			coffee-script, stylus, less, node-sass, ejs, uglify-js for js minification, csswring for CSS minification
	
	default directory for assets
		assets/css and assets/js

	setup
		var assets = require('connect-assets');
		app.use(assets({
			helperContext: app.locals,
			paths: ['assets/css', 'assets/js']
		}))
		// by default, it enables minification and caching in production but disables them in development
		// by default, it attaches its helpers to the global object. the helperContext above attaches them to app.locals

	link to assets from views
		two major helper functions
			js		returns a <script> tag
			css		returns a <link> tag

		// in jade
			!= css('my-css-file')	// make sure you don't escape
			!= js('my-js-file')

2. Heroku, a simple way to deploy your Node.js app on Internet
	install Heroku Toolbelt
	prepare your app
		make sure to start the app on process.env.PORT
			cuz Heroku use this environment parameter to specify port number

		make sure your package.json lists a Node version
			"engines": {
				"node": "^4.2.x"
			}

		create a file named Procfile in your app
			// in the file
			web: npm start
			// npm run produnction, if you have a npm script as below
			// "produnction": "forever bin/www"
		
		add a .gitignore
			don't push node_modules onto Heroku, it will npm install

	deploy
		commit your project to git
		# heroku create
			will add a remote git server named heroku
		# heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
		# git push heroku master
		# heroku ps:scale web=1
			tell it to run your app with one process
		# heroku open
			open it in the browser

	running Grunt on Heroku
		no need to worry about connect-assets
		but as for Grunt
			add a npm script:
				"postinstall": "grunt build"
			// then after npm install, grunt build will be called

3. optimistic versioning
	5.1.0
		5 is major version
			a major version upgrade can have a breaking change (may be not compatible)
		1 is minor version
			generally means a new feature that doesn't break existing code
		0 is patch version
			for bug fixes and performance enhancements
	
	^5.1.0
		indicates optimistic versioning is allowed
		will get all patch and minor updates
	~5.1.8
		indicates a slightly less optimistic versioning
		will get patch updates
	(with optimistic versioning, npm install will install the latest version allowed)
	
	to lock down dependency versions
		--save-exact
			but this will not lock down the version's subdependencies
		
		npm shrinkwrap
			creates a npm-shrinkwrap.json containing the whole dependency tree with exact versions
			npm install will look for npm-shrinkwrap.json before package.json

		to manually update a package
			npm install express@4.12.1
			then npm shrinkwrap again
	
4. localize dependencies
	why
		what if they don't have the global package you require
		what if they have a wrong version
