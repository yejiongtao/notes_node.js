1. other web application frameworks
	Hapi.js
		a relatively small framework that has routing and middelware-like functionality
		a pretty mature framework that used by Mozilla, OpenTable and npm registry, etc
		probably Express's biggest competitor

	Meteor
		larger, full-stack framework
			running code on both client and server side
		Express is unopinionated about how you build your applications but Meteor has a strict structure

	Kraken
		techically just a middleware built otop Express 
		sets up a lot of your application
			from security defaults to bundled middleware
	
	Sails.js
		another framework built atop Express that adds databases, WebSocket integration, API generators, an asset pipeline, and more

	Connect
		only the middleware layer
			doesn't have routing or some additional APIs
		Express once used Connect for its middleware layer
			now Express middleware is completely compatible with Connect middleware
	
	outside the Node.js world
		Ruby's Sinatra, Python's Bottle and Flask, PHP
			similar to Express
		Python's Django, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, Java's Play
			more opinionated frameworks with lots of features

2. MEAN stack
	MongoDB (a javascript-friendly database)
	Express
	Angular (a front-end javascript framework)
	Node.js

3. helpful middlewares
	connect-ratelimit
		lets you limit connections to a certain number of requests per hour
