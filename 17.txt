	session
		data that's attached to a particular user
		Express keeps session data in memory

	enable sessions in Express
		app.use(require('cookie-parser')());
			// responsible for parsing incoming cookies from the client
		app.use(require('express-session')({ secret: 'unguessable' }));
			// stores the session data attached to the cookie
			// 'secret' is used to sign the session cookies to prevent tampering and spoofing
