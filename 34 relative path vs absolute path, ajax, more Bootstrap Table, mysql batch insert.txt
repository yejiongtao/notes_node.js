1. 相对路径与绝对路径
	html中的都要写成绝对路径！
		包括href、src
	src中 / 指的是你static resources的位置
	href中 / 指的是网站的首页

2. use ajax to upload file
	see crash.pug in liscenceServer

3. use bootstrap on the file uploader
	see crash.pug in liscenceServer

4. use a column as a link
	use formatter
		th(data-field= col, data-formatter='nameFormatter')=col
	js
		function nameFormatter(value) {
		    return '<a href="crash/files/' + value + '">' + value + '</a>';
		}

5. mysql 批量插入
	insert one row at a time
		5000 ms for 10000 records
		the overhead of opening and closing connections is pretty large

	insert into table1 values (), (), ()...
		insert all rows at a time, 200 ms for 10000 records

	load data infile
		load data directly from a file, 100 ms for 10000 records
		suitable when the data is in a file
			LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name'
			[IGNORE | REPLACE]	// the way to deal with those with duplicated primary keys
			[FIELDS
				[TERMINATED BY 'string']
				[ENCLOSED BY 'char']
				[ESCAPED BY 'char']
			]
			[LINES
				[STARTING BY 'string']
				[TERMINATED BY 'string']
			]
			[IGNORE number LINES]
			[(col1, @dummy, @var1 ...)]
			[SET col3 = @var1/100, col4 = expr2, ...]

		the file must in the directory specified by secure_file_priv
			secure_file_priv is set in my.ini
			to show the current setting
				SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";
			to find where the mysql data is saved
				SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "datadir";
